//! Bridge-signer liveness / heartbeat (plan §B.8).
//!
//! Each seated node publishes a bridge-signer heartbeat that extends `beldexd`'s
//! `uptime_proof`: a version marker, the TSS transport identity, an EVM-tip
//! freshness marker, and a liveness flag. Missed heartbeats feed the liveness
//! path (Phase F.4): *ejection-without-slash* (bond returned after unbonding), so
//! a benign outage is not punished as Byzantine.
//!
//! This module computes the local liveness the node would report. Publishing it
//! into the (consensus-gossiped) `uptime_proof` is done on the C++ side (Phase
//! B.8) — deliberately not modified from a wire-format perspective here.
