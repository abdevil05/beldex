//! Session-message authentication (**S4 mesh hardening**).
//!
//! The curve-authenticated OMQ mesh ([`omq_mesh`](crate::omq_mesh)) gives
//! confidentiality and *dial-time* peer-key pinning, but the `from` index carried
//! **inside** a [`WireMsg`](crate::wire::WireMsg) is otherwise self-declared: a
//! peer that has a channel to us could stamp another member's index on a message
//! and forge an ACK/NACK/round-contribution "from" them. Until `from` is bound to
//! an authenticated identity, the session transcript is not attributable and the
//! Phase F slashing evidence built on it (S4) is forgeable.
//!
//! This module closes that gap by **signing every `WireMsg` with the sender's
//! bridge-signer ed25519 key** and verifying, on receipt, that the signature is
//! valid under the key registered on-chain for the claimed `from` index. Binding
//! `from` to a signature (rather than only to the transport's curve identity) has
//! two benefits over a ZAP allow-list: it is transport-agnostic (works in tests
//! with no sockets), and the signed message is itself **transferable evidence** —
//! exactly what a slashing report needs (S4 / Phase F).
//!
//! The signed region is the message's canonical [`WireMsg::encode`] output, which
//! already covers `leg`, `epoch`, `payload_hash`, `attempt`, `from`, and the body
//! — so a valid signature pins the sender *and* the full content, and an attacker
//! cannot lift a signature onto a different message or a different `from`.
//!
//! ## Layering (why this is a trait, not a hard libsodium dependency)
//!
//! The *binding logic* — "verify the signature under member[from]'s key, reject
//! otherwise" — is pure and must be tested without any crypto crate (the default
//! std-only build). So the ed25519 primitive is injected via [`Ed25519`]:
//!   * production wires it to libsodium ([`crate::ffi`], `--features tss-integration`),
//!     the *same* verifier the gateway consensus path uses;
//!   * tests use a deterministic in-crate double so the forge/tamper/stale cases
//!     run everywhere.
//!
//! The transport key is the member's **`signer_ed25519`** (the bridge-signer / TSS
//! transport identity bound in its on-chain `bridge_registration`), which the
//! signer learns per-member from the committee/seat view. It is a transport-auth
//! key, **not** a threshold share — S1 concerns the committee keys `Pevm`/`Pgw`,
//! which never live in this process in assembled form.
