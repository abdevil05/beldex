//! The broadcast seam. A relayer's **only** key is a gas-paying EOA, entirely unrelated to
//! any bridge key — a [`TxSubmitter`] signs and broadcasts the outer EVM transaction that
//! carries an already-signed [`PreparedCall`]. The trait keeps the courier logic testable
//! (a [`MockSubmitter`] records calls) and lets the real broadcast backend be swapped in.
//!
//! The real backend now lives in [`crate::http_submit`] (feature `submit-http`): it builds the
//! EIP-1559 envelope ([`crate::eip1559`]) around the `PreparedCall`, signs it with a funded
//! gas key, and `eth_sendRawTransaction`s it. That key carries **no bridge authority** — the
//! committee signature is inside the calldata — so running the service is optional and
//! untrusted: [`RelayPayload::to_prepared`] still yields the `{chain_id, to, data}` any user
//! can broadcast with `cast send`, so the bridge is **never liveness-blocked on a relayer**.
