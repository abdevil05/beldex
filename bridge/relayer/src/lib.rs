//! # Beldex Sovereign Bridge — keyless relayer (**Phase I**)
//!
//! A relayer is a **permissionless, keyless courier**: it carries an already-committee-signed
//! wBDX payload to its destination EVM chain and pays gas to broadcast it. It holds **no
//! bridge key** and forges nothing — the authorizing signature is complete before a relayer
//! touches it, and the wBDX contract verifies it on-chain. Relayers are therefore **never a
//! trust component** (whitepaper §3.1): if every relayer disappears, any user builds the same
//! transaction from the signed payload and submits it themselves, so the bridge is never
//! liveness-blocked on relayers.
//!
//! ## What this crate provides
//!   * [`abi`] — byte-exact ABI calldata for the two signed wBDX calls a relayer carries,
//!     `mint(...)` and `rotateSigner(...)` (selectors + encoding pinned against
//!     `bridge-contract/src/WrappedBDX.sol`).
//!   * [`payload`] — [`payload::RelayPayload`], a self-contained signed payload, its JSON
//!     codec (the signer→relayer / user→relayer handoff), and [`payload::PreparedCall`], the
//!     exact `{chain_id, to, data}` to broadcast (or hand to `cast send` / a wallet).
//!   * [`submit`] — the [`submit::TxSubmitter`] broadcast seam + a mock.
//!   * [`rlp`] + [`eip1559`] — a minimal RLP encoder and type-2 transaction construction
//!     (sighash + signed envelope), both pure and tested.
//!   * [`http_submit`] (feature `submit-http`) — the **reference gas-paying service**:
//!     resolve nonce/fees/gas, sign the outer envelope with a funded key, broadcast. The gas
//!     key carries **no bridge authority** (the committee signature is inside the calldata),
//!     so a leak costs gas, never funds.
//!
//! The **submit-your-own** liveness guarantee is delivered today by
//! [`payload::RelayPayload::to_prepared`]: no key, no service, no trust — just the calldata.
